**Setup:**
Just download and run it from browser.

**What to improve next time:**
The entire thing :) In all seriousness, I created this after learning JS for a bit over a month, there are lots of things to improve on.

1. In general, use OOP better. But more specifically:
2. Encapsulate data and abstract it. There are also lots of global variables.
2. Make functions shorter and break them up. They do too much and is hard to follow them.
3. Use the JS built-in key press data. I created an object that has ASCII code for each key, to identify which key has been pressed. I had no idea that the time that JS has it built in. 
4. Modularize the code. This code is difficult to extend on because it's all in one place and tough to read.
